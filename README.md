<h5>uploading my computer networks lab works</h5> <br>
1 Implement three nodes point – to – point network with duplex links between them. Set the
  queue size, vary the bandwidth, and find the number of packets dropped.<br>
2 Implement transmission of ping messages/trace route over a network topology consisting of 6
  nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion.<br>
3 Implement an Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and plot congestion
  window for different source / destination.<br>
4 Develop a program for error detecting code using CRC-CCITT (16- bits).<br>
5 Develop a program to implement a sliding window protocol in the data link layer.<br>
6 Develop a program to find the shortest path between vertices using the Bellman-Ford and path
  vector routing algorithm.<br>
7 Using TCP/IP sockets, write a client – server program to make the client send the file name
  and to make the server send back the contents of the requested file if present.<br>
8 Develop a program on a datagram socket for client/server to display the messages on client
  side, typed at the server side.<br>
9 Develop a program for a simple RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the data.<br>
10 Develop a program for congestion control using a leaky bucket algorithm.<br>
